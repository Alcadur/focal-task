Description
====

This is a result of one of the "coding challenges" during the recruitment process I had in the past. Until now, I deleted all that kind of repos but this one looks fascinating, so I decided to keep it (and improve it in the future).

Main assumptions
====

- user can draw rectangles on the image
- after drawing user can select and edit rectangles by moving corners
- during editing zoom should be displayed
- each shape should have different colours
- shapes can be deleted

Plans for the future
====

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add the possibility to add more corners
- [ ] Fix input/output mismatch
- [ ] Improve UI

P.S.: That list can be changed in the future.
